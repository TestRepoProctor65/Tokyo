# Tokyo
This is a project delegated to collaborating in GitHub
# Included within this repository are the instructions for this project
<h3>1. Create a GitHub repository called Tokyo</h3>
<h3>2. Clone this repository in two different folders: John and Amy.  We're trying to simulate two users collaborating on this repository.</h3>
<h3>3. Go to John's folder and make a commit.</h3>
<h3>4. Go to Amy's folder and fetch the new commit. View the history and see how the remote master branch has moved forward.  Merge origin/main into main.</h3>
<h3>5. From Amy's folder, create a new branch called feature/login.  Make a commit on this branch.  Now do a push.</h3>
<h3>6. View the local and remote branches.</h3>
<h3>7. Go to John's folder and do a fetch.  View the history. Note the new branch.  Create a local branch and map it to origin/feature/login. View the local and remote branches again to make sure your branches are set up properly.</h3>
<h3>8. Go back to Amy's folder, make another commit on the feature branch and do a push. </h3>
<h3>9. Back to John's folder, pull Amy's changes into the feature branch.  View the history.  The feature branch should be two commits ahead of the main.</h3>
<h3>10. Merge the feature branch into main. View the history.  Note that main is ahead of origin/main by two commits.  So now you need to do a push to bring origin/main forward.  View the history again to make sure main and origin/main are in the same place.</h3>
<h3>11. You're done with the feature branch.  So it's time to remove it.  Now, view the local and remote branches.  The remote tracking branch is gone, but the local branch is still there and should be removed.</h3>
<h3>12. Go to Amy's folder.  Do a fetch.  View the history. Note that origin/main has moved forward and is ahead of master by two commits.  Switch to main and merge origin/main into it.  View the history to ensure main and origin/main are at the same location.</h3>
<h3>13. It's time to remove the local and remote-tracking branches.</h3>
